# Automating-Crypto-Website-API-Pull.
This repository automates the process of pulling cryptocurrency data from a website's API using Python's requests library. It utilizes popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process, analyze, and visualize the collected data. The project includes a script that pulls data from the API at regular intervals, updates the dataset, and displays the new dataset with updated cryptocurrency information.

# Features:
1. API Data Pulling: The script leverages the API Requests library in Python to pull cryptocurrency data from a website's API[CoinMarketCap]([https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest](https://coinmarketcap.com/))
2. Data Processing: Pandas and NumPy are used for efficient processing and manipulation of the collected data, including data cleaning, transformation, and calculation of metrics.
3. Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed to create insightful visualizations, such as time series plots, histograms, and correlation matrices, to analyze cryptocurrency trends and patterns.
4. Automatic Updates: The script is designed to automatically update the dataset at regular intervals (e.g., every minute), ensuring real-time data availability.
5. Interactive Display: The updated dataset with cryptocurrency information is displayed automatically, providing users with up-to-date insights into the cryptocurrency market.
