# Automating-Crypto-Website-API-Pull.
This repository automates the process of pulling cryptocurrency data from a website's API using Python's requests library. It utilizes popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process, analyze, and visualize the collected data. The project includes a script that pulls data from the API at regular intervals, updates the dataset, and displays the new dataset with updated cryptocurrency information.

# Features:
1. API Data Pulling: The script leverages the API Requests library in Python to pull cryptocurrency data from a website's API [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)
2. Data Processing: Pandas and NumPy are used for efficient processing and manipulation of the collected data, including data cleaning, transformation, and calculation of metrics.
3. Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed to create insightful visualizations, such as time series plots, histograms, and correlation matrices, to analyze cryptocurrency trends and patterns.
4. Automatic Updates: The script is designed to automatically update the dataset at regular intervals (e.g., every minute), ensuring real-time data availability.
5. Interactive Display: The updated dataset with cryptocurrency information is displayed automatically, providing users with up-to-date insights into the cryptocurrency market.

# Repository Structure:
1. 'Automating Crypto Website API Pull.ipynb': Contains the Python script for automating the API data pull, data processing, and visualization.
2. README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

# Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt using pip.
3. Run the 'Automating Crypto Website API Pull.ipynb' script to start the automation process.
4. The script will pull cryptocurrency data from the website's API, update the dataset, and display the new dataset with updated cryptocurrency information at 
   regular intervals.
